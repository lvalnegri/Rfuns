\description{
The UK postcode system is hierarchical, the top level being "Postcode Area" (PCA) identified by 1 or 2 alphabetical character.
The next level is the "Postcode District" (PCD), also commonly known as the "outcode", and can take on several different formats, and anywhere from 2 to 4 alphanumeric characters long.
Next comes the Postcode Sector" (PCS), always identified by a single number, then finally the "unit", always formed by two alphabetical characters.
The combination of "sector" and "unit" is often called "incode", which is always 1 numeric character followed by 2 alphabetical characters.
